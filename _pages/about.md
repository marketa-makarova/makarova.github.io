I am a doctoral student at Masaryk University advised by Jan Koláček. I obtained my bachelor degree in Financial Mathematics and my masters degree in Statistics and Data Analysis. My research interest lies in the area of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning. I am working on developing analytical methods which are motivated by the need provide computational tools to help aid biomarker discovery and advance our understanding of biological processes.
